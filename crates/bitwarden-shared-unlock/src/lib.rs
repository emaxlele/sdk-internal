//! # Shared Unlock Protocol
//!
//! Synchronizes vault lock state across multiple Bitwarden clients (web, browser extension,
//! desktop) running in the same session. When a user unlocks their vault on one client, the
//! unlock propagates to all connected clients.
//!
//! ## Leader-Follower Model
//!
//! The protocol uses a leader-follower architecture where each client type has exactly one
//! leader determined by the device hierarchy:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Web Client  ──follows──▶  Browser Extension  ──follows──▶  Desktop App
//!   CLI Client  ──follows──▶  Desktop App
//! ```
//!
//! - **Leader**: Holds authoritative lock state, broadcasts state changes to all followers.
//! - **Follower**: Reports local state changes to its leader, applies authoritative updates from
//!   the leader.
//!
//! A client can be both a leader (to clients below it) and a follower (to the client above it)
//! simultaneously. For example, the browser extension leads web clients while following the
//! desktop app.
//!
//! ## Message Types
//!
//! All messages are serialized as CBOR and sent over the IPC transport.
//!
//! | Message          | Direction          | Purpose                                           |
//! |------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
//! | `StartSession`   | Follower → Leader  | Announce presence with current lock state         |
//! | `LockStateUpdate`| Bidirectional      | Propagate lock/unlock events                      |
//! | `HeartBeat`      | Bidirectional      | Keep session alive, suppress vault timeout        |
//!
//! ## Session Lifecycle
//!
//! ### Follower Startup
//!
//! ```text
//!   Follower                          Leader
//!     │                                 │
//!     │──StartSession(user, state)─────▶│  Follower announces itself
//!     │                                 │  Leader applies state if unlocked
//!     │◀─LockStateUpdate(user, state)───│  Leader responds with authoritative state
//!     │                                 │
//! ```
//!
//! On startup, the follower sends a `StartSession` for each logged-in user. If the follower
//! is unlocked and the leader is locked, the leader unlocks using the provided user key.
//! The leader always responds with a `LockStateUpdate` containing the authoritative state.
//!
//! ### Lock/Unlock Propagation
//!
//! **User unlocks on follower:**
//!
//! ```text
//!   Follower A                        Leader                         Follower B
//!     │                                 │                                │
//!     │──LockStateUpdate(Unlocked)─────▶│                                │
//!     │                                 │──unlocks locally──             │
//!     │                                 │──LockStateUpdate(Unlocked)────▶│
//!     │                                 │                                │──unlocks locally──
//! ```
//!
//! **User locks on leader (via device event):**
//!
//! ```text
//!   Leader                          Follower A                     Follower B
//!     │                                 │                                │
//!     │──LockStateUpdate(Locked)───────▶│                                │
//!     │──LockStateUpdate(Locked)────────┼───────────────────────────────▶│
//!     │                                 │──locks locally──               │──locks locally──
//! ```
//!
//! ### Heartbeat Keep-Alive
//!
//! ```text
//!   Follower                          Leader
//!     │                                 │
//!     │──HeartBeat(user)───────────────▶│  Every N seconds
//!     │                                 │  Leader updates last-seen timestamp
//!     │◀─HeartBeat(user)────────────────│  Leader echoes back
//!     |◀─LockStateUpdate────────────────│  Leader always sends an authoritative state update to prevent desyncs
//!     │──suppresses vault timeout──     │
//!     │                                 │
//! ```
//!
//! The follower sends a `HeartBeat` for each logged-in user every [`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`]
//! On receiving the echo, the follower suppresses its vault timeout timer,
//! keeping the vault unlocked as long as the session is active. Stale sessions are pruned.
//!
//! ## Security Definitions
//!
//! - Attacker Model:
//!   - Attacker gains user-space access to the device while the vault has been locked (steals the
//!     device)
//! - Security Goal:
//!   - Attacker cannot gain access to the vault key material
//!
//! This security definition is aimed at stolen or seized devices. Forensics should not uncover
//! (passively) recorded or otherwise left behind key material. The IPC encryption prevents such a
//! compromise.
//!
//! There is no further protection provided against active attackers running in userspace while the
//! vault is unlocked on any of the clients on the device.
//!
//! - Attacker Model:
//!   - Attacker controls a website that is not the web vault
//! - Security Goal:
//!   - Attacker cannot gain access to the vault key material
//!
//! This is met by origin validation.
