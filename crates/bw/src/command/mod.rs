//! CLI command definitions and argument parsing for the Bitwarden CLI (`bw`).
//!
//! This module defines the top-level [`Cli`] struct and the [`Commands`] enum that together
//! describe every subcommand accepted by the CLI. Parsing is handled by
//! [clap](https://docs.rs/clap) using its derive API.
//!
//! Subcommand that have an explicit owner lives under the team's corresponding module, such as the
//! `sync` subcommand living under the `platform` module. Subcommands that don't have a clear owner,
//! such as `get item`, live in this module. Each subcommand has a `run` method that executes the
//! command's logic and returns a [`crate::render::CommandOutput`].
